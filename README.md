The main project file in this repo is 'kaggle_playground.ipynb'. In this file you will find the VAE architecture I am 
using to construct audio examples from the GTZAN dataset. These samples are then evaluated against the training distribution using
KL Divergence as a distance metric between samples. 

Other files in the repo were used as inspiration and for borrowing code.
